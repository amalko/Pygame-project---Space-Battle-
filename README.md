# Pygame-project---Space-Battle-

Here, a simple space battle is developed with the help of some youtube tutorials and made few changes. Game is developed using the 'pygame' module in python. In this battle, we get a spaceship with which we can shoot multiple enemies moving in the space. On hitting the target, score gets incremented automatically. And the game gets over when any one of the enemies reaches a particular level in the gaming window. On hitting the enemy, it gets destroyed and gets respawned in some random location on the screen. 


What I learned from the project:
Got to know the basic functionality of pygame module.
Adding background musics in the game.
Creating moving objects with images.
Generating multiple moving objects on the screen.
Generating objects on random locations on the screen.
